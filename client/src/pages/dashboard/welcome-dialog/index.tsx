          75 years into the digital era, much of our online communication is still rooted in the
          linear strictures of print. Browsers make us jump from tab to tab, thus obscuring a sense
          of the whole, including how the different bits are connected, all of which robs the
          “reader” of valuable context.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Tapestries people can create non-linear presentations that are more in synch with the
          way our re-wired brains are beginning to understand the world — as a multi-faceted
          assemblage of related ideas, letting authors dynamically explain how things are connected.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tapestries are <Text component="em">not</Text> simply lists of links, requiring the user
          to click and go somewhere else. Rather they are an array of functional objects: each one
          visible and ready to be accessed and explored.
        </p>
        <p>
          You create a Tapestry by dragging digital objects — text, images, audio, video, software
          and entire web pages onto a blank infinite canvas. Size and placement is entirely up to
          the author.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tapestries can be displayed anywhere. Think of Tapestries as portable compound
          illustrations comprised of fully functional digital objects which can be embedded on any
          web page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Readers can comment on any part of a Tapestry or on the whole. Comments can be public or
          posted to a private group. For deeper collaboration, you can also invite other people to
          edit a Tapestry with you.
        </p>
        <p>
          If creators have given permission, readers can make their own editable copies and remake
          them as they please.
